We need to find the perimeter of triangle DOE.\n\nSince E is the midpoint of CD, DE = EC. Also, since AC is a diagonal of the parallelogram, it bisects BD. Therefore, BO = OD = BD/2 = 12/2 = 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the perimeter of triangle DOE. The perimeter of triangle DOE is the sum of the lengths of DO, OE, and DE.\n\n1. DO = OD = 6 (since BD is a diagonal and bisects it)\n2. Since E is the midpoint of CD, DE = EC = CD/2. We know that the perimeter of parallelogram ABCD is 36, so CD = 36/4 = 9.\n3. Therefore, DE = EC = 9/2 = 4.5\n4. The perimeter of triangle DOE is DO + OE + DE = 6 + 4.5 + 4.5 = 15",

Given that BP = 6.0 and angle P = 30°, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the lengths of the sides. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the 30°, 60°, and 90° angles is 1:√3:2.\n\n3. Since OB is the radius and angle P is 30°, we know that OB = 2 * (1/2) = 1.0. Therefore, the",
